Features:

Converts a single request OB config into a standalone .exe cracker
Console based output showing statistics in the title and the cracking progression on screen
Two proxy libraries, one for limited retries and another for no limits
Fast task based multi-threading system
Completely automated process




Limitations:

Config variable: "Name": cannot contain any whitespace.
Will only work on configs with a single "POST" request, no redirects.
Does not use status codes for anything
Captures only works via regex (LR in the config) - matching between two strings - NO JSON !
No conditions on keychecks work and will break the program.
